        <h2>Conceptual Response</h2>
        <p>
          I created a prototype called Emotion Dice, is an interactive web that
          users can roll a dice to trigger a piece of music that represents a
          specific emotion, users not just directly control what they want to
          listen, but they explore the music through a creative way with
          randomness and playfulness. By connecting the dice with emotions, this
          prototype becomes like a self-discover tool, the randomness mirrors
          the unpredictability of human emotions themselves, users can feel
          engaging through interact and experience the different emotions of
          music. This prototype follows the creative prompt of skeuomorphism,
          the design makes users feel like they are playing with the real dice,
          which let the interface intuitive and evoke emotional engagement
          through the experience.

        <h3>Interface Reference</h3>
        <p>
          For this prototype, I been inspired by the casino dice. When watching
          the dice roll it creates a sense of anticipation and excitement, which
          I also want to bring out the unpredictability feeling throughout my
          prototype. One similar project I found is called
          <a
            class="link-r"
            href="https://dice.virtuworld.net/emotions/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Dice Virtu World</a
          >, this web shows a digital dice roll that will randomly generates
          various emotions, just like my prototype, but this web more focus on
          textual prompt, however, my design extends the concept in music and
          sounds, which users can be more engaging through the experience and
          makes the prototype more playful and interesting.
        </p>
        <h3>Audio Reference</h3>
        <p>
          For the audio of this prototype, I sourced the music from
          <a
            class="link-r"
            href="https://pixabay.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Pixabay</a
          >, which is a platform that provides royalty-free audio to avoid
          copyright issues. I tried to find the music that match with the
          emotions that represented on the dice and enhanced the emotional
          mapping and the concept of the design.

        <p>
          For the visual planning of the prototype, I sketched the dice faces
          those present different emotions with minimalist and cartoon-like
          style, which let the users feel friendly and characterful. Through the
          simple face icon can enhances the readability, let the users can
          recognize the expressions even with small size.

      <!-- techinical -->

        <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
        <p>
          The main technique I utilized for my prototype was Math.random, in
          order to simulate the unpredictability of rolling dice. When users
          click the Roll the Dice button, this Math.random will generate a
          random number from 0 to 5, which is an index to the faces array that
          includes all the dice images and their related music audios.
          Therefore, when the result is selected, the dice face shows up and
          automatically playing the corresponding music. To simulate the
          movement of the rolling dice, the prototype using setInterval() to
          cycle the dice faces rapidly before it stop, creates a sense of
          playfulness. The audio elements and volume slider allow users to
          control the output of the sounds to present the cohesive system of
          this design.

        <h3>My Feedback Prompts</h3>
        <p>
          <li>Did rolling the dice feel fun and engaging?</li>
          <li>
            Was the connection between the dice result and the music clear to
            you?
          </li>
          <li>Did you like the music choices for each emotion?</li>
          <li>Did the panel work well?</li>
          <li>Is the interface easy to understand at first glance?</li>
        </p>
        <h3>Feedback Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Through peopleâ€™s feedback, I learned that the interface was clear and
          easy to understand with the intuitive mapping and instructions. They
          also felt that the connection between the dice result and the chosen
          music was strong, which audios match with the corresponding faces.
          People reflect that the process of rolling the dice is fun and
          engaging, which shows that the prototype successfully creates the
          interactive and playful experience. However, some of the feedbacks
          still mention the opportunities to improve. While the built in audio
          player is functionally, but I want to replace through customized play
          and pause button to more align with the style of the whole interface.
          Through testing other peopleâ€™s prototypes, reminds me to add the alert
          that the sound will play when interact with the web, to improve
          accessibility of the user experience. These changes will help refine
          both the usability and the cohesiveness of the overall design.
